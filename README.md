This repository contains a Power BI report analyzing key metrics in the mining industry. The report offers operational insights into production efficiency, workforce distribution, mine type impact, and safety compliance.

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- **Production Efficiency**: Mines with higher working hours and larger teams didn’t always yield higher output; efficiency varied with safety compliance and mine type.
- **Safety Committees**: Sites with active safety committees showed better safety index scores and production metrics.
- **Mine Type Distribution**: Surface mines dominate in count but vary in productivity compared to underground operations.
- **Workforce vs. Output**: Scatter plot analysis reveals workforce size doesn't always correlate with total methane output.

## 📊 Dashboard Features:
- Bubble scatter plot linking employees, working hours, production efficiency, and safety indicators.
- Bar charts showing distribution across mine types.
- KPI cards summarizing total production, employee count, and average efficiency.
- Dynamic filters for state, mine type, and year.
